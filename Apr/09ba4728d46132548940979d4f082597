After families were separated and displaced in the 1994 Rwandan genocide an NGO, Save the Children, took initiative and launched an operation to reunite the children with their families. On an attempt to understand and share the childrenâ€™s history, the NGO decided to find out what had happened to some of them twenty years later. Fortunately they did mange to find one family that has three siblings who had never seen pictures of themselves as children. The results are special - watch the video in the gallery above.
