Members of the women's Colombian cycling team IDRD-Bogota Humana-San Mateo-Solgar, who participated in the Tour of Tuscany in Italy, during a press conference in Bogota, Colombia, 17 September 2014. BOGOTA - Cyclists from Colombia have appealed to the International Cycling Federation (UCI) in defence of their controversial flesh-coloured kit. Brian Cookson, president of the International Cycling Federation (UCI), had previously described the outfits as "unacceptable," after a team picture went viral on the internet. The team participated in a race in Italy over the weekend wearing uniforms that were flesh-coloured over the pelvic area, making the team look naked below the waist. They have reportedly been wearing the outfits since January, but didn&39;t garner international attention until the race. In Bogota, coach Jorge Tenjo said the uniforms would be sent to Cookson. "I keep telling the girls to remain confident in their abilities, that they have to keep going strong, because what happened was just the manipulation of an obscene person who took and posted the photo," Tenjo said. The designer, who is also a member of the IDRD-Bogota Humana-San Mateo-Solgar team, reiterated her defence of the uniform, saying that it has the colours of the team&39;s sponsor. "As sponsors of the team, we support them as we have done from the beginning," said IDRD director Aldo Cadena. "I don&39;t think it&39;s necessary to change the uniform." - Sapa-dpa
