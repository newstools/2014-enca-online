Colonel Eugene de Kock (C), head of the apartheid-era police death squads, standing in front of one of the houses with South African police where he allegedly tortured and murdered apartheid opponents. CAPE TOWN - The gruesome truth behind Vlakplaas and its commander, Eugene de Kock, may have remained secret had it not been for two fearless journalists. Jacques Pauw and Max du Preez were senior journalists at the legendary anti-apartheid newspaper, Vrye Weekblad. They broke the story of De Kock and Vlakplaas in 1989 when no other mainstream media outlet would dare. Pauw has written several books about the horrors of apartheid. He was one of the first civilians -- not a victim of, or worker at Vlakplaas -- who got a horrifying glimpse into its modus operandi. He says De Kock was a quiet man. He did not have the face of a monster – yet he killed at least 120 people. “He was a very ominous man because he didn’t appear to be the death squad commander," said Pauw. "He wears thick glasses and could be a teacher or an ouderling in the church. Certainly not the Prime Evil that his men called him.’’ * Watch Annika Larsen&39;s interview with Jacques Pauw and Max du Preez in the gallery above.
